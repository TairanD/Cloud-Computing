# Distributed File System

## 1 - Data Storage in the age of Cloud Computing
The volume of data generated by human activities is growing by about 40% per year; 90% of the data in the world
today has been gathered in the last two years.

The network-centric data storage model is particularly useful for **mobile devices** with limited power reserves and
local storage. These devices are now able to save and access large audio and video files stored on **computer clouds**.
Billions of Internet-connected mobile, as well as stationary devices, access data stored on computer clouds.

Big Data reflects the reality that many applications use **data sets so large** that local computers, or even 
medium-scale data centers, **do not have the capacity** to store and process such data.

The management of a large collection of storage systems poses significant challenges and requires novel approaches
to system design. Effective data replication and storage management strategies are critical to the computations 
performed on the cloud.

### 1.1 - Major Challenges
The storage system design philosophy has shifted from performance-at-any-cost to reliability-at-the-lowest-possible-cost.
This philosophy has important implications on software complexity. Maintaining **consistency among multiple copies**
of data records increases the data management software complexity and could **negatively affect** the storage system
**performance** if data is frequently updated.

Sophisticated strategies to reduce the access time and to support multimedia access are necessary to satisfy the timeing
requirements of data streaming and content delivery.

**Data replication** allows **concurrent access** to data from multiple processors and **decreases the chances of data loss**.

### 1.2 - Data Storage on a Cloud
Storage and processing on the cloud are intimately tied to one another.
- Most cloud applications **process very large amounts of data**. Effective data replication and storage management strategies
are critical to the computations performed on the cloud.
- Strategies to reduce the access time and support real-time multimedia access are necessary to satisfy content delivery
requirements.
