# Introduction - Cloud Computing

## 1 - Scenario
Big Data → how to manage data (store, share, access, process, ……) efficiently and effectively? 

## 2 - Definition
Cloud computing: “Cloud computing is a **model** for enabling **ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand** network access to a **shared pool** 
of configurable **computing resources** (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be 
rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”

## 3 - Cloud Service Types
1 - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Offers **virtualized computing resources**, such as virtual machines, storage, and networks.
2 - Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a platform and tools for application development and deployment without managing the underlying infrastructure (for user).
3 - Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance (for user).

## 4 - Benefits
1. Scalability: Cloud services can be easily scaled up or down based on demand.
2. Flexibility: Users have the flexibility to choose and adapt services to meet specific business needs.
3. Cost-Efficiency: Cloud computing often follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model (usage-based pricing), allowing organizations to pay only for the resources they use.
