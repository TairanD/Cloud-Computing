# Serverless Computing

## 1 - Motivation
Traditional Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) models require **long-term server** allocations, leading to **low resource
utilization** (about 10% on average). This inefficiency has driven the development of **platform-managed, on-demand services**,
known as serverless computing, which offer higher resource utilization and lower costs. Major cloud vendors such as 
Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Alibaba provide these services.


## 2 - Introduction
Serverless computing reduces the granularity of computing to the **function level**, **simplifying** management for developers.
Developers only need to write **cloud functions in high-level languages** (e.g., Java, Python), 
**set several simple parameters**, and **upload** these functions to a serverless platform. Then, 
they could use the **returned API or HTTP requests** to execute their well-defined computation tasks.
Serverless computing leaves the **management and scheduling issues to the platform**.

Besides, serverless providers always deploy application-dependent services, also known as 
**Backend as a Service (BaaS)**, for their customers, such as **Database** and **Object Storage Services (OSS)**.
