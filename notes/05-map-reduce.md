# Map Reduce

## 1 - Data-Intensive Computing
Large volumes of data need to be efficiently stored, made accessible, indexed, and analyzed in many fields like social
networking.

Distributed computing can help address challenges generated during performing these tasks by providing more scalable
and efficient storage architectures and better data computation and processing performance. 

### 1.1 What's Data-Intensive Computing 
Data-intensive computing is concerned with the **production**, **manipulation**, and **analysis** 
of **large-scale data**, ranging from hundreds of megabytes (MB) to petabytes (PB) and beyond.

### Applications
1. Computational science
2. Bioinformatics applications
3. Earthquake simulators
4. Social networking
5. Gaming


## 2 - Introducing the MapReduce Programming Platform

### 2.1 - Programming Platforms
Platforms for programming data-intensive applications provide **abstractions** that help **express computation** over a large
quantity of information and runtime systems that can efficiently manage huge volumes of data.

Traditionally, database management systems based on the relational model have been 
used to express the **structure and the connections between the entities** of a data model. This approach has proven to 
be **ineffective** in the case of “Big Data,” where information is 
mostly **unstructured or semi-structured** and where data is most likely to be organized in 
large files or a huge number of medium-sized files rather than rows in a database.


### 2.2 - The MapReduce Programming Model
MapReduce is a programming platform introduced by Google to **process large quantities of data**. 
It expresses the computation logic of an application into two simple functions: **map** and **reduce**.

The computation of MapReduce applications is then organized in a **workflow of the 
map and reduce operations** that are entirely controlled by the runtime system.
